# GuessNumber
This is a simple and funnies project with an Arduino UNO and the famous "keypad shield".

The Keypad shield is a famous shield for Arduino UNO that has an LCD and 5 switch buttons. You can use the LCD and buttons for creating everything you want. The most projects use the Arduino UNO and the keypad shield like datalogger. I want to use my Arduino UNO and keypad for making the famous "Guess The Number Game".

Do you know the game?

It's really simple. The goal of the game is the secret number. Arduino UNO chooses a number, and you must discover this. You have only 5 possibilities. The sequence of the game is:

1. Arduino chooses a number. This is the secret number;

2. You can choose the number on the screen by using two switches and after the choosing, you can confirm your number;

3. If the number that you have chosen is the secret numbrer, you have won. Else, Arduino gives a tip like "The secret number is more biggest";

4. After 5 attempts, if you not have discovered the secret number, you have loose the game.

I love this game!
